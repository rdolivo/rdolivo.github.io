# Python and R!

After taking this course, I have gained more knowledge about R Studio and began learning about Python! I have learned their differences, but they can still give the same outputs and can intertwine/communicate with one another using reticulate.

## Working With Reticulate
First, I had to install reticulate from its library. Here is the R Studio code in assigning content to a variable:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
school <- "One More"
```

Here is the Python code in assigning content to a variable:
```{python}
school="Semester! :)"
print(school)
```

And finally, here is the code that combines both to create my following message:
```{python}
print(r.school,school)
```

Though their code is different they still serve the same purpose and are able to communicate with eachother creating the message above! I enjoyed this course a lot and would like to thank Dr. Woodward for a great semester. Hook em!
