      <description>Introduction My dataset includes numerical, categorical, and binary variables about police-reported car accidents that resulted in a harmful event and at least one car was towed in the year 1999. I found this interesting because people can be reckless drivers and I wanted to see the information on these accidents because I was also born in 1999. Thisdata is pertaining to the front seat occupant at the time of the accident.</description>

      <description>Introduction The two datasets I have chosen were the happiness scale numbers of countries and the alcohol consumption that corresponds to those countries to see if there is a correlation between the two. The variables within this are the country, the happines ranking, the happiness score, and the alcohol consumption per capita. The alcohol consumption per capita is divided in three sections: beer, spirits, and wine. I picked this because I knew about the happiest countries and also how alcohol is a depressant, so I am wondering how their alcohol consumption will impact their emotions causing a decrease or increase in happiness.</description>
